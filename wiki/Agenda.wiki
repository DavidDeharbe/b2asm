You will find described here an agenda of this research.


= Introduction =

The goal of the b2asm project is to develop a model-based approach that will provide assembly level code generation. Using the well-established *B method*, we will be able to proved a 100% guarantee that the generated code is faithful to the initial model. The b2asm project is therefore aiming to develop a _verifying compiler_, and to contribute fulfilling one of the grand challenges of computer science, stated by Tony Hoare.
