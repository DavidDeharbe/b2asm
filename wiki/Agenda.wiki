You will find described here an agenda of this research.


= Introduction =

The goal of the b2asm project is to develop a model-based approach that will provide assembly level code generation. Using the well-established *B method*, we will be able to proved a 100% guarantee that the generated code is faithful to the initial model. The b2asm project is therefore aiming to develop a _verifying compiler_, and to contribute fulfilling one of the grand challenges of computer science, stated by Tony Hoare.

= Details =

The project is currently in a phase where we try to establish the feasibility of the approach. Our methodology is to:
* build abstract (B) models of computing platforms, such as the instruction set of a family of micro-controllers;
* develop small B projects down to assembly level, using the abovementioned of the corresponding instruction sets.
